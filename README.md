Hello everyone.
This repo contains PhP, JS, GraphQL, Bash and some CSS code. In most cases it is somwhow WordPress related as this is a platform I mostly use for my development. Check out the folders to see what is there.
I try, most of the time, to provide comments so code is more unsderstandable to other people. If something is unclear, feel free to ping me, but I do not guerantee fast response, it may happen or may not, depending on when I notice it, or have time to address it.

However feel free to use the code found in here, and if possible attribute me, this is always nice.
Most of the time I am not looking for new gigs, but if you need some custom work done, feel free to ping here or at [Abecede Studio](mailto:studio@abecede.net)
